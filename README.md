# Leveraging Machine Learning as a Mechanical Engineer 

I have been interested in the intersection of engineering simulation and physics-based machine learning for many years.  My background is in nonlinear structural finite element analysis, and machine learning was a natural step.  My first exposure to ML came around 2014, when I leanred about K-Means Clustering to group elements in a model by their stress-strain definition for conitnued simulation using another software package.  The initial simulation was a welding simulation with a moving heatsource.  The metallurgical phases in the heat affected zone and solidified region had property definitions based on heat exposure and cooling rates - every element in the HAZ and weld bead had a different stress-strain curve!  This level of detail was not feasible for continuation analysis in another FE package, so I used K-Means Clustering to group elements with similar stress-strain curves.

I created my first end-to-end FEA-surrogate model in early 2022, which entailed Abaqus scripting, Python routines to extract and organize data, surrogate model definition in Tensorflow, and an optimization wrapper in SciPy.  I had used many of these tools individually prior to this project.  Since then, I have explored PINNs and MeshGraphNets for different types of problems.  I have also explored 3d CNNs for flaw detection of CT-Scanned parts.

Outside of work, I am contributing to a couple research papers in the medical field by creating tile datasets and fine-tuning EfficientNet CNNs (more on that soon).  

Check out my portfolio for several example projects!
