# Mechanical Engineer with Strong Machine Learning Skills

I have been interested in the intersection of engineering simulation and physics-based machine learning for four years.  My background is in nonlinear structural finite element analysis, and machine learning was a natural step.  I created my first end-to-end FEA-surrogate model in early 2022, which entailed Abaqus scripting, Python routines to extract and organize data, surrogate model definition in Tensorflow, and an optimization wrapper in SciPy.  Since then, I have explroed PINNs and MeshGraphNets for different types of problems.  I have also explored 3d CNNs for flaw detection of CT-Scanned parts.  Outside of work, I am contributing to a couple research papers in the medical field by creating tile datasets and fine-tuning EfficientNet CNNs (more on that soon).  

Check out my portfolio for several example projects!
